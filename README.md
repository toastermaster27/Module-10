  ## [Description]

  This application generates a profile card for a team member when their information is entered into the terminal.

  ## [Purpose]

  This application was created to prioritize efficiency in the workplace by saving time editing your team. For example, a user would no longer have to go in manually and edit the HTML when  a team member is added or lost, they just have to type their name and information into the terminal.

  ## [What I Learned]

  When building this application, I learned a lot about object-oriented programming and also learned a fair bit on debugging.


  ## [Installation]

  To use this application, download or clone the code and run it in the terminal.


  ## [Usage]

  This project can be used to save time and prioritize important tasks.
